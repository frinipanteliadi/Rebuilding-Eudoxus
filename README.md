# Rebuilding-Eudoxus
Our take on redesigning the [Eudoxus](https://eudoxus.gr/) Web Application, a service provided by [Greece's Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs](https://www.minedu.gov.gr/) for the acquirement of textbooks by university students.

This project was the third and final assignment for the [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://en.uoa.gr/), [Department of Informatics and Telecommunications](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en) undergraduate [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en/studies/undergraduate/90) course.

## What is Eudoxus? 📚

Eudoxus is an online service provided by Greece's Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs to the country's undergraduate university students. It enables them to browse through, select and order university textbooks, according to their curriculum, free of charge.

## Why should it be redesigned? 🤔

A quick navigation through the application's website reveals a couple of its many flaws. The lack of a search bar, the clutter of text in the center of the homepage, the use of the same image for different functionalities and the lack of simple navigation and links are only some examples of bad web design found in Eudoxus. These factors make the website very hard to use as well as frustrating, despite having to be used by almost all undergraduate students in Greece each semester.
